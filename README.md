# CS 330 Module 8 Journal

**How do I approach designing software?**

Working on this project has allowed me to develop several valuable design skills. I've learned how to create basic geometric shapes like triangles, pyramids, cubes, and cylinders, which serve as the foundation for constructing complex 3D scenes. Additionally, I've gained proficiency in handling user interactions, including mouse movements and keyboard inputs, making my applications more interactive and engaging. Furthermore, I've acquired knowledge in applying textures to 3D objects, enhancing the visual aesthetics and realism of my scenes. Lastly, I've explored lighting techniques, including adjusting ambient lighting, which has enabled me to create more visually appealing and immersive 3D environments. These skills not only contribute to the success of my current project but also provide a strong foundation for future work in 3D graphics, game development, and interactive software design.

In my project work, I followed a structured design process that primarily revolved around leveraging external OpenGL learning resources and module tutorials provided by SNHU CS-330. These resources equipped me with essential knowledge and skills to create various 3D shapes, implement mouse movements and keyboard inputs, apply textures, and incorporate lighting into my scene. Additionally, I adopted an iterative approach, starting with simpler components and gradually adding complexity to my 3D scene. Regular testing and debugging ensured that each element functioned correctly before proceeding to the next. This design process, which combined theoretical learning with hands-on practice and iterative development, was instrumental in the successful completion of my project.

The tactics from my design approach can be applied effectively in future work across various domains of computer graphics and software development. First, the practice of learning from external resources and tutorials will remain valuable, as it ensures a strong foundation and keeps me updated with industry-standard techniques. Additionally, the iterative development approach, which involves gradually building and testing components, can streamline the development process and reduce errors in future projects. Furthermore, the emphasis on structured learning and hands-on practice can be extended to acquire new skills and tackle more complex projects. Overall, the design tactics I employed have provided a structured framework for approaching future work, ensuring continued growth and success in the field of computer graphics and software development.
